### Development Goal for Workday: EOTR (End of the Run) Automation

#### Goal:
Automate the End of the Run (EOTR) process to enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and streamline workflow.

#### Objectives:
1. **Analyze Current EOTR Process:**
   - Document the current manual EOTR processes.
   - Identify bottlenecks and areas prone to errors.
   - Collect feedback from stakeholders on current pain points.

2. **Define Automation Requirements:**
   - Determine the necessary software and tools for automation.
   - Define the scope and specifications for the EOTR automation.
   - Ensure compliance with company policies and data security standards.

3. **Develop Automation Scripts:**
   - Create scripts to automate the identified EOTR tasks.
   - Use a suitable scripting language (e.g., Python, JavaScript) or automation tools (e.g., Workday Studio, UIPath).
   - Ensure scripts are modular, maintainable, and well-documented.

4. **Integrate Automation with Workday:**
   - Implement the automation scripts within the Workday environment.
   - Test the integration thoroughly to ensure it works seamlessly with existing processes.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Conduct comprehensive testing (unit, integration, system testing) to validate the automation.
   - Engage stakeholders in user acceptance testing (UAT).
   - Identify and fix any issues or bugs discovered during testing.

6. **Training and Documentation:**
   - Develop user manuals and training materials for the automated EOTR process.
   - Conduct training sessions for relevant employees and stakeholders.
   - Ensure all team members understand how to use the new system and troubleshoot basic issues.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring:**
   - Roll out the automated EOTR process in a phased manner.
   - Monitor the automation performance closely post-deployment.
   - Collect feedback for continuous improvement.

8. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Set up regular review sessions to assess the effectiveness of the automation.
   - Identify areas for further enhancement.
   - Implement iterative improvements based on feedback and performance metrics.

#### Timeline:
- **Month 1-2:** Analyze current process and define requirements.
- **Month 3-4:** Develop and test automation scripts.
- **Month 5:** Integrate automation with Workday.
- **Month 6:** Conduct testing and validation.
- **Month 7:** Training and documentation.
- **Month 8:** Deployment and monitoring.
- **Month 9 onwards:** Continuous improvement.

#### Success Metrics:
- **Efficiency:** Reduction in time taken to complete EOTR processes.
- **Accuracy:** Decrease in errors associated with EOTR tasks.
- **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from stakeholders and users.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduction in labor costs due to automation.

By achieving this goal, the organization will improve operational efficiency, enhance accuracy, and provide a better user experience with the automated EOTR process.
